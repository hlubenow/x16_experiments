### x16_sprite.c 1.0

This is a translation of a [BASIC sprite example by Slithy Matt](https://github.com/SlithyMatt/x16-sprite/blob/master/sprite.bas) to C. A sprite is created on the Commander X16, and is moved around on the screen.
The C-code is supposed to be compiled with CC65. The compilation line can be found in the .c-file.

As I didn't know better yet, this is a rather literal translation of the BASIC example.
There is [another Commander X16 sprite example in C by Slithy Matt](https://github.com/SlithyMatt/x16-demo/blob/master/cc65-sprite/demo.c) though, which probably shows better, how this kind of code should be written in C.
